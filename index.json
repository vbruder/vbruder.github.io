A specific focus is put on the support of analyzing temporal aspects in the data. Central to our approach is a static, volumetric representation of the dynamic graph based on the concept of space-time cubes that we create by stacking the adjacency matrices of all time steps. The use of GPU-accelerated volume rendering techniques allows us to render this representation interactively. We identified four classes of analytics methods as being important for the analysis of large and complex graph data, which we discuss in detail: data views, aggregation and filtering, comparison, and evolution provenance. Implementations of the respective methods are presented in an integrated application, enabling interactive exploration and analysis of large graphs. We demonstrate the applicability, usefulness, and scalability of our approach by presenting two examples for analyzing dynamic graphs. Furthermore, we let visualization experts evaluate our analytics approach.","tags":null,"title":"Volume-Based Large Dynamic Graph Analytics Supported by Evolution Provenance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kuno Kurzhals"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561384252,"objectID":"e6d9a5546e4220ad1aac0c78e6f3109d","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/talk/2019-etra/","publishdate":"2019-05-11T11:54:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-etra/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of our ETRA 2019 paper.","tags":[],"title":"Space-Time Volume Visualization of Gaze and Stimulus","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Valentin Bruder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559725800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561384252,"objectID":"f1cc5e8b226124acd657c2487a5cabe0","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/talk/2019-eurovis/","publishdate":"2019-05-11T11:54:31+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-eurovis/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentation of our EuroVis 2019 short paper.","tags":[],"title":"Voronoi-Based Foveated Volume Rendering","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Valentin Bruder","Kuno Kurzhals","Steffen Frey","Daniel Weiskopf","Thomas Ertl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559340000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557741100,"objectID":"3d0894f3025830541c96388112b250c2","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/publication/dblp-confetra-bruder-kfwe-19/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confetra-bruder-kfwe-19/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a method for the spatio-temporal analysis of gaze data from multiple participants in the context of a video stimulus. For such data, an overview of the recorded patterns is important to identify common viewing behavior (such as attentional synchrony) and outliers. We adopt the approach of space-time cube visualization, which extends the spatial dimensions of the stimulus by time as the third dimension. Previous work mainly handled eye-tracking data in the space-time cube as point cloud, providing no information about the stimulus context. This paper presents a novel visualization technique that combines gaze data, a dynamic stimulus, and optical flow with volume rendering to derive an overview of the data with contextual information. With specifically designed transfer functions, we emphasize different data aspects, making the visualization suitable for explorative analysis and for illustrative support of statistical findings alike.","tags":null,"title":"Space-time volume visualization of gaze and stimulus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Bruder","Christoph Schulz","Ruben Bauer","Steffen Frey","Daniel Weiskopf","Thomas Ertl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559340000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561384252,"objectID":"b8024263bc6365a80927fd70cb9c43d9","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/publication/bruder-sbfwe-19/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bruder-sbfwe-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Foveal vision is located in the center of the field of view with a rich impression of detail and color, whereas peripheral vision occurs on the side with more fuzzy and colorless perception. This visual acuity fall-off can be used to achieve higher frame rates by adapting rendering quality to the human visual system. Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement. Our approach substantially improves rendering performance with barely perceptible changes in visual quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through performance measurements on various data sets.","tags":null,"title":"Voronoi-Based Foveated Volume Rendering","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552321344,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552330379,"objectID":"0e198f3ea1a6f130d9ee03002e487211","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/project/trrojan/","publishdate":"2019-03-11T17:22:24+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/trrojan/","section":"project","summary":"We developed the TRRojan framework for systematic empirical evaluation of the performance of visual computing algorithms.

Consequently, many methodologies and best practices for user studies have evolved. While maintaining interactivity continues to be crucial for the exploration of large data sets, no similar methodological foundation for evaluating runtime performance has been developed. Our analysis of 50 recent visualization papers on new or improved techniques for rendering volumes or particles indicates that   only a very limited set of parameters like different data sets, camera paths, viewport sizes, and GPUs are investigated, which make comparison with other techniques or generalization to other parameter ranges at least questionable. To derive a deeper understanding of qualitative runtime behavior and quantitative parameter dependencies, we developed a framework for the most exhaustive performance evaluation of volume and particle visualization techniques that we are aware of, including millions of measurements on ten different GPUs. This paper reports on our insights from statistical analysis of this data, discussing independent and linear parameter behavior and non-obvious effects. We give recommendations for best practices when evaluating runtime performance of scientific visualization applications, which can serve as a starting point for more elaborate models of performance quantification.

This reduces the overall size of the image while preserving details. Our application determines the encoding settings in two steps. In the first step, we predict the quality and size of the tiles for different encoding settings using a convolutional neural network. In the second step, we assign the optimal encoder setting to each tile, so that the overall size of the image is lower than a predetermined threshold. Commonly, for tiles that contain complicated structures, a high quality setting is used in order to prevent major information loss, while quality settings are lowered for others to keep the size below the threshold. We demonstrate that we can reduce the overall size of the image while preserving the details in areas of interest using the example of both particle and volume visualization applications.","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive Encoder Settings for Interactive Remote Visualisation on High-Resolution Displays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Bruder","Marcel Hlawatsch","Steffen Frey","Michael Burch","Daniel Weiskopf","Thomas Ertl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554223620,"objectID":"bdd4731e3f384775b9b69602d6bfbb40","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/publication/dblp-confiv-bruder-hfbwe-18/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-confiv-bruder-hfbwe-18/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an approach for interactively analyzing large dynamic graphs consisting of several thousand time steps with a particular focus on temporal aspects. we employ a static representation of the time-varying graph based on the concept of space-time cubes, i.e., we create a volumetric representation of the graph by stacking the adjacency matrices of each of its time steps.

On the basis of timing measurements from a single cluster as well as from individual GPUs, we are able to predict the performance gain of upgrading an existing cluster with additional or faster GPUs, or even purchasing of a new cluster with a comparable network configuration. To achieve this, we employ neural networks to capture complex performance characteristics. However, merely relying on them for the prediction would require the collection of training data on multiple clusters with different hardware, which is impractical in most cases. Therefore, we propose a two-level approach to prediction, distinguishing between node and cluster level. On the node level, we generate performance histograms on individual nodes to capture local rendering performance. These performance histograms are then used to emulate the performance of different rendering hardware for cluster-level measurement runs. Crucially, this variety allows the neural network to capture the compositing performance of a cluster separately from the rendering performance on individual nodes. Therefore, we just need a performance histogram of the GPU of interest to generate a prediction. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using different cluster configurations as well as a range of image and volume resolutions.","tags":null,"title":"Prediction of Distributed Volume Visualization Performance to Support Render Hardware Acquisition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Bruder","Steffen Frey","Thomas Ertl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557741100,"objectID":"85f38afb2691c2ef2262da5158a8510a","permalink":"https://vbruder.github.io/publication/dblp-journalsvi-bruder-fe-17/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-journalsvi-bruder-fe-17/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an integrated approach for real-time performance prediction of volume raycasting that we employ for load balancing and sampling resolution tuning.
